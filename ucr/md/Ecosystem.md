# GeneWiki Ecosystem

(Aspirational) components:

- specs - collaboratively design ecosystem to facilitate inferencing of genetic and exognenous factors for cell function.
- libraries - tools to interface with ML platforms, GWAS software, etc.
- publications - collection of acquired knowledge with sufficient metadata to enable search and truth/hypothesis maintenance, e.g. reference genome. Publications may span different stores, such as the EBMI VCF files.
- distribution - infrastructure to knit publications together.
- executables - tools to:
  - manage publications - push to appropriate databases
  - migrate VCFs between reference genomes - lean on 
  - raw data? illumina/affymetrix formats?
  
  
## Implementation language

1. Rust - provides simplest language bindings to e.g. Python, Java, Ecmascript, etc.
2. Typescript - WebApp tools reduce impedance a lot.
3. Python - trendy.
