# GWAS

Which E. coli genes are associated with antibiotic resistance?

## Why GWAS?
Longitudinal sequencing provides control for relatedness between strains, making GWAS approaches reasonable.

1. Full-sequence strain.
2. Introduce challenge (antibiotic)
3. Sample and separate at small-n-generation intervals
4. Perform GWAS exploiting heritage 
5. NextGen sequence these to get variants
6. goto 2.
