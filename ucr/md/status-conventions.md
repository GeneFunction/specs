# Status conventions

Documents and libraries specify their maturity level with these enumerations, loosely-based on [WebAssembly phases](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/phases.md) and [ECMAScript phases](https://www.proposals.es/stages).

0. Pre-Proposal [individual crackpot idea]
1. Feature Proposal [buy-in from multiple crackpots]
2. Feature Description Available [someone's worked out interactions]
3. Implementation Phase [someone's written code]
4. Standardize the Feature [consensus on tests]
