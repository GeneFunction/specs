# WebIDL Guide

The WebIDL Guide provides a structured approach to defining interfaces using WebIDL (Web Interface Definition Language), which is essential for describing APIs in web browsers. Here's a summary of its key aspects:

1. Defining Interfaces
Use blocks to define interfaces.

Example:
<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window]
interface Request {
    readonly attribute ByteString method;
    readonly attribute USVString url;
};
</pre>
2. Linking Setup
Organize interfaces and their methods/attributes using \<section> tags with data-dfn-for attributes to establish parent-child relationships.

Example:

<section data-dfn-for="Request">
    <h2>Request interface</h2>
    <pre>
    interface Request {
        readonly attribute ByteString method;
        readonly attribute USVString url;
    };
    </pre>
</section>
3. Handling Multiple Interfaces
When multiple interfaces share attributes or methods, explicitly distinguish between them using data-dfn-for.

Example:

idl
interface Request {
    readonly attribute USVString url;
};
interface Response {
    readonly attribute USVString url;
};
4. Convenient Linking
Use {{InterfaceName/MethodName}} syntax for linking methods and attributes to their definitions.

5. Advanced Features
Child-Parent Relationships: Define relationships between methods and their parent interfaces.

Cross-Referencing: Link attributes or methods across different interfaces.

This guide is particularly useful for creating well-structured and easily navigable technical documentation. If you'd like to explore specific examples or dive deeper into WebIDL, let me know!
